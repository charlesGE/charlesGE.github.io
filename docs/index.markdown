Greetings!

I am a PhD student at [Mila, Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/fr/annuaire/charles-guille-escuret) affiliated 
with [Université de Montréal (UdeM)](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), under the supervision of [Ioannis Mitliagkas](http://mitliagkas.github.io/). I am expecting to graduate in March 2025.
 
The core of my PhD research focused on first-order optimization for deep learning (both theoretical and empirical). I am convinced that the shortcomings of optimization theory in 
explaining modern practice is due to over-reliance on inadequate assumptions. I have seeked to improve our understanding of the geometrical properties of empirical objective functions to 
improve the theoretical frameworks through which they are studied. I have also conducted many application-oriented projects on a variety of topics, such as pretraining a 7b LLM on 1.2T tokens, out-of-distribution detection,
current prediction in aircrafts, adversarial robustness, detection on images, etc. 

During my PhD, I also had the priviledge to intern at [ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/research/) with Joao Monteiro and Torsten Scholak, and at [Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) with Eugène Ndiaye. 
Before starting my PhD, I was a visiting scholar for a year at [UC Berkeley's EECS department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) under the supervision of
[Alexandre Bayen](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/bayen.html). I completed my Masters in applied mathematics at
[École Normale Supérieure de Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en).

On top of my research, I have been a co-organizer for the [4th Neural Scaling Laws Workshop](https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/scaling-laws-workshop),
a teaching assistant for [UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/)'s [IFT3395](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/ift-3395/) and
[IFT6390](http://mitliagkas.github.io/ift6390-ml-class/), [HEC Montreal](https://www.hec.ca/en/)'s MATH80629A and Edulib's SD1FR MOOC. I also co-supervised
the internship of three students from [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)'s professional masters program.

Moving forward, I intend to focus my effort on research grounded in practical applications, seeking to achieve immediate improvements over existing methods.

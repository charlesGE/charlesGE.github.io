Greetings !
 I am a PhD student at the [Mila, Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) affiliated
 with [Université de Montréal (UdeM)](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), under the supervision of [Ioannis Mitliagkas](http://mitliagkas.github.io/). I am also a part-time visiting researcher at
 [ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/research/) under the supervision of [João Monteiro](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=hkO47vsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Before starting my PhD, I was a visiting scholar for a year at [UC Berkeley's EECS department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) under the supervision of
[Alexandre Bayen](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/bayen.html), where I worked in collaboration with [SafelyYou](https://www.safely-you.com/)
to detect falls in elderly care facilities. During our pilot, we were able to reduce ER visits by 80% and fall frequency by 40%.

I completed my Bachelors in computer sciences and Masters in applied mathematics at
[École Normale Supérieure de Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en). I prepared for the entrance competition at
[Lycée Fénelon](https://pia.ac-paris.fr/serail/jcms/s2_1470075/fr/accueil).

My research focuses on **first-order optimization for deep learning**. In particular, I am interested in improving our understanding of neural networks loss landscapes
in a way that allows us to obtain theoretical results with practical significance. I am also interested in broader **learning dynamics theory**, such as
understanding the relationship between the inner dimension of learned manifolds and **scaling laws**, **multiple descent**, **phase transitions**. Finally,
I am interested in developping practical OOD detection systems to improve the reliability of predictions in real-world systems.

On top of my research, I am a co-organizer for the [4th Neural Scaling Laws Workshop](https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/scaling-laws-workshop),
have been a teaching assistant for [UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/)'s [IFT3395](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/ift-3395/) and
[IFT6390](http://mitliagkas.github.io/ift6390-ml-class/), [HEC Montreal](https://www.hec.ca/en/)'s MATH80629A and Edulib's SD1FR MOOC. I also co-supervised
the internship of three students from [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)'s professional masters program.

My favorite paper is [Stopping GAN Violence: Generative Unadversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02528.pdf), which I believe to be highly relevant to
anyone enjoying british humor and who can afford to waste a bit of time.

Outside of work, I am fond of outdoor adventures, music festivals, and long term travels.

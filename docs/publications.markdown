# Expecting The Unexpected: Towards Broad Out-Of-Distribution Detection
**Charles Guille-Escuret**, Pierre-André Noel, David Vazquez, Ioannis
Mitliagkas, Joao Monteiro.

Under review at ICML 2023.

*Short summary: OOD detection methods have historically focused on the detection of samples from novel classes. Some parallel work have independently tackled the detection of adversarial samples or generated images. In this work, we introduce the benchmark BROAD for the detection of 5 different types of distribution shifts. We show that existing methods perform unreliably across novel distribution shift types, and propose an ensemble method which achieves significant gains in terms of averaged detection AUC.*

# [CADet: Fully Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection With Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01742)
**Charles Guille-Escuret**, Pau Rodriguez, David Vazquez, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Joao Monteiro.

Under review at ICML 2023.

*Short summary: in this work, we explore applications of self-supervised contrastive learning to the simultaneous detection
of adversarial samples and unseen classes on images. Our method is inspired by the efficiency of MMD two-sample test in
discriminating   distributions.*

# [Towards Out-of-Distribution Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03150)
Adam Ibrahim, **Charles Guille-Escuret**, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Irina Rish, David Krueger, Pouya Bashivan.to

Under review at ICML 2023. Subset presented at ICML 2022 New Frontiers In Adversarial Machine Learning Workshop.

*Short summary: adversarial robustness to a type of attack often does not transfer to other attacks, which substantially undermines the efficiency of
current methods. In this work, we view adversarial attacks as a type of distributional shift, and explore the use of the
Risk Extrapolation (REx), an out-of-distribution robustness method. Compared to existing works, we achieve better worst-case accuracy both
on the set of attacks seen during training and on a held-out set of attacks only seen at test time.*

# Prediction of Lightning Currents on Fastening Assemblies of an Aircraft Fuel Tank with Machine Learning Methods
Paul Monferran\*, **Charles Guille-Escuret**\*, Christophe Guiffaut, Alain Reinex.

Under review at IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility.

*Short summary: the precise prediction of currents on the fastening assemblies is an important challenge for the aircraft industry.
These predictions are usually performed through very computationally expensive simulations. In this work,
we use well-known machine learning methods such as XGBoost to perform accurate predictions at a small fraction
of the computational cost.*

# [Gradient Descent Is Optimal Under Lower Restricted Secant Inequality And Upper Error Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00342)
**Charles Guille-Escuret**, Adam Ibrahim, Baptiste Goujaud, Ioannis Mitliagkas.

Accepted at NeurIPS 2022.

*Short summary: previous works have outlined the unreliability of smoothness and strong-convexity as complexity metrics for the study of
first-order optimization, and proposed alternative conditions. We show that under a pair of such alternatives, gradient descent is exactly
optimal (not even up to a constant). Moreover, we introduce experiments showing that these conditions are empirically relevant to the optimization
of neural networks.*

# [A Study of Condition Numbers for First-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05782)
**Charles Guille-Escuret**\*, Baptiste Goujaud\*, Manuela Girotti, Ioannis Mitliagkas.

Accepted at AISTATS 2021. A subset was presented at NeurIPS 2020 Optimization for Machine Learning Workshop where it received the best student paper award.

*Short summary: In this work, we highlight and study pathological behaviors exposed by smoothness and strong-convexity when used as complexity metrics
for first-order optimization. We analyze how such phenomenons undermines the results theoretically derived under these conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a set of
alternative conditions which we show to be robust to these type of pathological behaviors, and for which we derive basic implications and convergence guarantees.*

# [InsectUp: Crowdsourcing Insect Observations to Assess Demographic Shifts and Improve Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11898)
Léonard Boussioux, Tomás Giro-Larraz, **Charles Guille-Escuret**, Mehdi Cherti, Balázs Kégl.

Presented at ICML 2019 Workshop on AI for Social Good and ICCV 2019 Workshop on Wildlife Conservation.

*Short summary: insect populations are a major indicator of biodiversity. However, their assessment is severly limited by the difficulty of collecting data
at sufficient scale. In this work, we propose a method to leverage observations from bystanders, hikers and citizen scientists to foster environmental research.
Moreover, we show that their is indeed interest from both sides in such collaboration.*
